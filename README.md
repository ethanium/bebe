**Language Description**

**Brief Background of BEBE**

The BEBE was originally derived from the initials of the creators of this programming language. It was then first called as BEM, which stands for Bagaporo-Escopete-Magno, the first three members, but they were not satisfied to the first name that came up so they decided to change it. After a huge brainstorming, another name was proposed Magno, one of the creators, he suggested the name BEBE. It is because Bebe is also his nickname and the name he always use in computer games.

 The language was written and created by Christian P. Escopete, Mark John A. Magno, Michael C. Caras and Jan Louie M. Bagaporo on January 27, 2007 to fulfill their requirements on the BCS321 subject (Structures of Programming Language). The main purpose of the language was to create a programming language that will be patterned from another programming language. It aims to help the developers of the language in learning about how to create a certain programming language and to also acquire knowledge from by means of their researched done during completing the project. It also covers some topics like Lexical Analyzer. BEBE will be a case-sensitive, imperative programming language. It features simple control flow and data types, several operators. BEBE may not be a complete programming language but it can do basic operations in programming.
